                <span> My name is Kayla L. Patterson and I am a rising Junior from Hampton University.
                    Throughout my six years of learning about the tech field, I have immersed myself 
                    with top tech companies learning what it takes to become a Software Engineer. Ever 
                    since I took my first Computer Science class in High School, I have fallen in love 
                    with this field. I have been given opportunities to compete in different Hackathons, 
                    intern at one of the top tech companies in the world, network with different professions 
                    in tech, and attend prestigious conferences to learn about different tech roles at different 
                    companies.<br> Computer Science is a huge part of who I am. Whether that is me coding my own 
                    personal website, learning different Machine Learning Models, or even programming an AI robot. 
                    Every topic dealing with code I have learned from inspiring people that have mentored me to 
                    improve on my craft. Mentorship is a huge part of my life especially being in the tech field. 
                    I have this passion to learn from not just my textbooks but people who inspire me every single 
                    day to be where they are now.

                        <hs2>Worked on the Google Play Store Team to create a tool to gain a better understanding 
                            of the features for ML modles. This tool was able to display information for debugging 
                            and explaining recommendations of different apps on the Play Store.The tool was also 
                            used on my team to visually see different ML modles and their data in one collected 
                            table.

                            Engineering Summit. This website was selected amongst 800 different applicants from top universities.
                            The goal of this project was to create a web application that answers questions from bike 
                            sharing data. I used Atom as my editor to create this website, and also the frameworks Bootstrap 
                            and Jquery to display differnt effects on this website.One effect that I am really proud of is a 
                            the parallex effect as well as changing the cursor to a bike.

                        <hs2>During the Capital One Software Engineering Summit Hackathon my team and I created an 
                            Android app called Trash Cash. The purpose of this app was to solve the issues of people
                            not recycling. This app allows people to take a picture of an item that they are not sure is
                            recyclable and then using the ML model Tensor flow, we were able to identify object that are recyclable
                            and are not recyclable. Then once they take a photo of the recyclable item being thrown in the trash, money
                            will go into their account for awarding themselves for recycling properly.

                       <hs2>Programmed a hummanoid robot on the Nemesis 2590 robotics team. The purpose of this project

                           program. The Nao robot was programmed using Python and was able to calculate different math problems, dance,
                           talk, and even throw a ball into a bucket. I worked on programming this robot for two years on my high school's

                <p>Being on the Google Play Store Team opened my eyes about Machine Learning. I truly am interested
                    in this field and want to learn more about it. I have been studying Python more and studying different
                    courses on Machine Learning using Coursera.

                <h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>
                <p>This interest emerged during high school, where I selected to program a humanoid robot. I was very 
                    excited because I have never programmed a robot before. Realizing the fun of programming them I have a 
                    tremendous interest in learning more about them.

                <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
                <p> Growing up I always wanted to protect people from fraud and identity theft 
                    because that is something that no one should ever go through. Protecting people's 
                    data is one of the things I am very passionate about, that is why I always
                    make sure to focus on creating efficent code to not be acceptable to hackers.
